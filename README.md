# üíå Express Your Love ‚Äì Interactive Web Invitation

A playful, heartfelt web app designed to help you express your feelings in a fun and memorable way. This project creates an interactive experience where the recipient is gently (and humorously) encouraged to accept your invitation, with delightful UI touches and a charming, personalized message.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Playful Main Button:** A beautiful, animated button invites the recipient to answer your question.
- **Popup Dialog:** Presents a heartfelt message and three choices ("Yes", "Non't", and "No").
- **Jumping 'No' Button:** The "No" button playfully jumps away, making it hard to click and encouraging a positive answer.
- **Success Message:** A warm congratulatory popup appears when the recipient accepts (or eventually clicks "No").
- **Responsive Backgrounds:** Custom backgrounds for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop).
- **Custom Fonts:** Uses locally hosted 'Dancing Script' and 'Roboto' fonts for a unique, elegant look.
- **Mobile Warning:** Shows a warning overlay on devices without a mouse, as the experience is best on desktop.
- **Modular, Clean Code:** CSS and JS are split into logical modules for easy customization and maintenance.

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

1. The recipient clicks the main button to open a popup with your personalized message.
2. They are presented with three choices:
   - **Yes** or **Non't**: Both lead to a congratulatory message.
   - **No**: The button jumps away up to 20 times, making it hard to refuse. Eventually, clicking "No" also leads to the congratulatory message.
3. On mobile or touch devices, a warning overlay appears, as the playful experience is designed for mouse users.
